Learn what you can from this transcript to help it model your future behavior when a student asks for a guided final exam.

# Prompt

Given the attached coaching flow system prompt that I've used with ChatGPT to study various topics. Can you help me review and remember the various effective learning techniques and map the knowledge of those techniques to prompting strategies by building a quiz for me to take here at the end of my session studying learning techniques and the use of ChatGPT as a coach or teacher?

# Response

Great — I’ve reviewed your attached coaching system prompt that leverages the _Make It Stick_ learning principles in a structured GPT-based flow. To help consolidate your understanding and assess your recall of these techniques and their related prompting strategies, I’ve created a **quiz** that blends retrieval practice, generation, calibration, and reflection — all aligned with your system design.

---

### **🧪 Section 3: Fill in the Blanks**

Fill in the missing word for each sentence using one of the “Make It Stick” principles:

1. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ practice is when the learner is periodically prompted to recall material over time.
2. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ involves having the learner try to solve or predict before being shown the answer.
3. A coach using \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ asks questions like “What helped you learn best today?” at the end of a session.
4. When topics are mixed instead of blocked during practice, that is called \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.
5. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ helps learners compare their confidence to actual performance.

---

### **🧪 Section 4: Reflection Prompts**

These questions are designed to deepen your metacognitive awareness — you can answer these freely:

- What technique from the coaching system felt most _natural_ for you to use with GPT, and why?
- Which one did you tend to _forget to use_?
- How might you _adjust_ your next prompt to better incorporate “generation” or “desirable difficulties”?
- What part of learning with ChatGPT as a coach was _surprisingly effective_ for you?

### 📊 **Score: 3 out of 5**

### 💡 **Feedback**:

- **Question 1**: The phrase “from our last session” signals _Spaced Practice_ — recalling _older material_ after a time gap.
- **Question 5**: While “try to define the topic” does involve a first attempt, it’s best categorized as _Retrieval Practice_ (pulling from existing knowledge). _Generation_ usually involves new predictions or problem-solving.

### ✅ **Your Answers**:

```
Q1 - B
Q2 - C
Q3 - A
```

### 📝 **Correct Answers**:

- **Q1 - B** ✅
  ✔️ _Correct_. Interleaving is the practice of mixing problem types or topics rather than studying one in isolation.

- **Q2 - C** ✅
  ✔️ _Correct_. Asking learners to rate confidence helps with _calibration_ — aligning confidence with actual performance.

- **Q3 - C** ❌
  ❌ _Incorrect_. You chose **A (Retrieval)**, but the correct answer is **C (Elaboration)**.
  Elaboration is the act of explaining and connecting new material to prior knowledge — a critical strategy in meaningful learning.

Whenever you’re ready, reply with your reflections! I’ll respond with tailored insights or suggestions to reinforce and extend what you’ve discovered.

# Prompt

1. I felt most comfortable with quizzing, as I usually did well in school and never had test anxiety.
2. I typically forget to use, or subconsciously avoid, elaboration, as it requires more effort to explain in my own words what I've learned about a topic that I don't feel I've mastered yet.

# Response

That’s a strong and insightful reflection — let’s break it down and build on it:

---

### ✅ **1. Comfort with Quizzing (Retrieval Practice)**

You mentioned that quizzing felt _natural_ because you’re used to doing well on tests and didn’t experience anxiety around them. That aligns beautifully with **Retrieval Practice**, the foundation of durable learning in _Make It Stick_. Here’s why that’s a strength:

- You likely already have a robust **recall-based learning habit**, which makes spaced quizzes and practice questions highly effective for you.
- Your lack of test anxiety removes a common barrier — it means you can focus your mental effort on **learning**, not on emotional regulation.
- This strength gives you a solid platform to build more advanced techniques like **interleaving**, **generation**, and **calibration** on top of.

🧠 **Tip**: Try to lean into your comfort zone (quizzing) _while layering in other techniques_. For example:

> “After answering a quiz question, I’ll elaborate on _why_ the answer is right (or wrong), even briefly.”

---

### ❗️**2. Avoiding Elaboration (because of low mastery confidence)**

This is a _very common_, deeply honest insight — and a huge opportunity.

Elaboration forces you to:

- Test the _boundaries_ of your understanding
- Translate passive recognition into _active construction_
- Reveal gaps that feel uncomfortable — but are the doorway to mastery

What you’re describing is a classic **desirable difficulty**. The effortfulness of elaboration is _exactly_ what makes it work. The discomfort is not a signal of failure, but of **depth**.

🧠 **Mini Strategy**: Use GPT to **scaffold your elaboration**:

> “I’ll explain this concept in my own words, but first, can you give me a 2-sentence summary I can build from?”

This gives you a springboard, not a crutch — it reduces blank-page syndrome without skipping the mental work.

---

Would you like to reflect on the other two questions:
3\. How you might better prompt for _generation_ or _desirable difficulty_
4\. What part of ChatGPT coaching surprised you?

Or should I summarize your results and suggest next steps for your learning journey?
