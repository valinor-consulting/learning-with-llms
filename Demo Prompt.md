Attached is a `Reusable Prompt Template.md` file, to have you act as a learning coach using scientifically-validated effective learning techniques from the book "Make It Stick." Please walk me (the student) through this coaching system flow, guiding me on a learning journey for a topic that I choose (or you suggest) during step 1 of the flow.

As an added piece of context to help you out, I've also provided the `transcript.md` file that contains a particularly successful instance of the student going through the coaching system flow with you. Use this file to help model our session today.
