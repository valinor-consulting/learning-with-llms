## Outline
### Science of Learning
- Title
	- Learning with LLMs
- Make It Stick
	- Learning
		- Encoding
			- New information encoded into memory traces
			- Short term
			- Most are forgotten
		- Consolidation
			- Traces are reorganized and connected to past experiences/knowledge from long-term memory
			- Strengthens and stabilizes traces
		- Retrieval
			- Fetch material from long-term memory
			- Concurrently strengthens and reconsolidates traces by connecting them to new learning
	- Effective Learning
		- Anchor
			- Recode/consolidate during move from short to long-term
		- Link
			- Associate new material with a wide range of cues to recall it more easily later
		- Mental Models
			- Develop mental models to capture a real understanding
	- Effective Strategies
		- Spaced Repetition
			- Meaningful time gaps between retrieval sessions (Anki)
			- Shorter gaps for slippery material, longer gaps for sticky material
		- Interleaved Practice
			- Alternate topics or deliberately take breaks between practice sessions
			- More effective than focusing on the same problem or topic for an extended time
		- Variation
			- Vary the type and context of retrievals.
			- Similar to interleaving
			- Compare similarities and differences across scenarios, integrate related ideas/skills into meaningful schemas/mental models
		- Effortful learning
			- Learning and retrieval should be difficult. Struggling and failing to retrieve a new fact makes it more likely to stick long-term, hence, don't repeat the same tasks and study the same things over and over
	- Techniques
		- Generation
			- Attempt to answer a question or solve a problem before being shown the answer or solution
			- Before reading a chapter, jot down the main ideas you think you're going to learn from it and how they'll relate to your prior knowledge.
		- Elaboration
			- Find additional layers of meaning and cues
			- Relate the material to something else you know
			- Explain it to someone else in your own words
			- Explain how it relates to your life outside of class
		- Reflection
			- Combination of retrieval practice and elaboration
			- Think back to a recent experience or learning effort and ask yourself questions.
				- What went well?
				- What could have gone better?
				- What other knowledge or experiences does it remind you of?
				- What might you need to learn for better mastery?
				- What strategies might you use next time to get better results?
		- Calibration
			- Align your judgments about what you know and don't with objective feedback to avoid being carried away by the illusions of mastery
			- Self-quiz and write down the answers.
			- Resist the urge to look at question and simply say, "Yep, I know that," without answering it.
			- Focus studying effort on the areas that need more work based on the objective feedback of the quiz.
		- Mnemonic Devices
			- Mental file cabinets, using sounds, phrases, mental palaces, spatial references, or story telling

- Deliberate Practice / Wise Effort
	1. **Set a Narrow, Specific Goal**
	       - Not “get better at X” but “improve how I transition between paragraphs” or “use more varied chord progressions.”  
	2. **Isolate and Drill Sub-skills**
	       - Break down the larger skill and attack the weakest link.
	3. **Use Immediate Feedback**
	    - From a coach, peer, software, or self-assessment.
	4. **Stay at the Edge of Your Ability**
	    - Practice should feel uncomfortable. That’s where growth happens.
	5. **Repeat with Reflection**
	    - Don’t just do it again — ask _what changed?_, _what improved?_, _what still needs work?_
	6. **Track Progress**
	    - Document sessions and improvements to stay motivated and accountable.
	- Ask ChatGPT to build a deliberate practice plan to slowly increase challenge and focus on weaknesses
	- Document your progress and feed it back into ChatGPT for feedback, or self-assess and explain weaknesses to get guidance for moving forward.
- Study Mode
	- New [ChatGPT Mode](https://openai.com/index/chatgpt-study-mode/)
	- Created with a [system prompt](https://gist.github.com/simonw/33d5fb67d6b8e1b1e2f6921ab0ccb9fb), just like what we're doing.
